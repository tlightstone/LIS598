I wasn't planning on reading this book because I had given up on Ali Hazelwood. I loved The Love Hypothesis, but then I really disliked the steminist novels that she put out because I felt like they were recycled and then I never picked up another one of her books. But, I was inspired to pick this one up, because I was a swimmer for 15 years of my life and I'm glad I did! <br/><br/>I really loved this book, with the emphasis on mental health and how that can affect Scarlett's diving. I also liked how they explored the dom/sub stuff with the acknowledgment on feminism and the control it brings. I'm not typically a fan of that stuff, but I liked how it was represented with the constant check ins from Luk, it felt caring and consensual which sometimes other books lack. <br/><br/>Loved this one! I think it's bringing me out of my reading slump. (I haven't read a book in 3 months) ",,,1,0,,No ISBN

It doesn't even say that it is on Goodreads. I didn't realize that until I was about a quarter of the way through and was confused why they were throwing all these characters at us, as if we were supposed to know them already. (Turns out we were supposed to know them already lmao) Even without the background, I think I have a good understanding of how the first book ended up going, with her current obsession with Ivan. <br/><br/>I thought this was a really interesting book with a very unique main character who was both relatable and unrelatable. Clearly Selin was incredibly smart, but lack the social understanding of lots of things. I probably didn't understand as much of the book as I would've liked, since I have no knowledge of any of the Russian literature that was referenced in the novel, but I still enjoyed it.",,,1,0,9780525557593,"education, coming of age, love, personal development, Women college students, Fiction, Identity (Psychology), Turkish Americans, FICTION / Literary, FICTION / Coming of Age, FICTION / Women, FICTION / Diversity & Multicultural"

Rereading my old review everything is still true. Except now we know that there will be a third one! <br/><br/>OG Review June 2021:<br/>Wow this was a whirlwind. I am in love with Victor Vale and it isn't surprising. He's such a fascinating character and impossible not to love. I found out recently that there is possibly a third book in this Villians world and you better believe I will be the first person to pre-order that book when it comes out. <br/><br/>I love that we were able to find out so much more about Eli's history and backstory and I thought that Marella's character was so fascinating. <br/><br/><spoiler> I think I'm in shock and denial that Eli died. I really wanted it to be a battle of wit and have Victor figure something out and kill Eli but it happened to be that crazy scientist instead. And the scientist, I can't even remember his name was so insignificant it almost seems unfair. But I really like that Sydney was the one who pulled the trigger to finish Eli off since Victor wasn't the one able to do it. <br/><br/>I'm sad that Victor kinda left Sydney and Mitch in the dust and walked away. I think that Sydney must be the key to saving him since she was the one who revived him in the first place. Like maybe they kill Victor and Sydney can bring him back fixed. <br/><br/>Also I've always wondered what would happen if Eli was decapitated. Does his head grow a new body, or does his body grow a new head. That would've been interesting to explore. </spoiler> <br/><br/>I love this book so much! This Villians universe is definitely one of my favorites.",,,2,0,,No ISBN

My favorite book of all time. <br/>I'm rereading it now for the Shadow and Bone TV show coming out on April 23, 2021. <br/><br/>Once again, I'm shocked by how beautiful Bardugo's writing is. The way it flows and melds together is beautiful. Every single word keeps my eyes glued to the page. Even though it's my fourth time reading it, it always feels like it's my first.  <br/><br/>Kaz  Brekker is  the ultimate guy. He's dark and brooding and insane, but somehow realistic. I love how Bardugo creates these characters that are so strong and powerful, but all of them have incredibly deep flaws that keep them grounded. I'll never get tired of this book. Never. It's amazing and I'm so glad to have read it.<br/><br/>Edit May 7, 2024:<br/>This is my 5th time reading this book because I bought the special LitJoy Crate edition with annotations written by Bardugo herself.

I liked Kai's personality but Isa seemed too much like ""I'm not like other girls."" As someone who had purple hair for a long time, and owns a pet snake I was excited to read this book. That she would actually have a unique personality different from other girls. That she could actually be your normal everyday girl. <br/><br/><spoiler> What was the reason for making it so she was actually the daughter of a family that still was worth hundreds of millions of dollars?

I was extremely hesitant to read this book originally. I had sworn it off because I sorta feel like it's a cash grab, or Rick Riordan is just bored and doesn't know what to do. I'm not sure I disagree with that, but I'll tell you my thoughts and feelings of the actual novel. <br/><br/>I LOVE Percy Jackson. When I say that I don't mean it lightly. Growing up through the end of elementary school and early high school, I read, and reread all the major 10 books in the series. (PJO and HOO) Well, the last 3 books of HOO I had to wait in anticipation yearly, and read on the days it came out. I was part of online fandom communities, and discussion boards. This series was my childhood, the way Harry Potter was for a lot of millennials. And I didn't fall off after that either. I still read all Magnus Chase Books and Trials of Apollo. Then during the pandemic, I reread all of PJO and HOO again! Safe to say I'm a big fan and it's really important to me. <br/><br/>This book did NOT disappoint me. The writing felt timeless and goofy. It felt like I was reading a continuation of Percy as a senior in high school, although maybe his tone is slightly immature for a senior in high school, but I understand the book is still considered middle grade so that could be it. I liked seeing the original trio back together again, although more of Annabeth would've been nice. <br/><br/>The book had a simple formula of the Percy Jackson books, though there wasn't really any fighting or monsters in it. I kinda liked that. Like, give Percy a break, he's been through enough. I can see that this is going to be book 1/3 in the series probably, and I'll pick up the rest to read too. I liked the book, and it hit the nostalgia spots in a good way. ",,,1,0,9781368098175,New York Times reviewed

This book was really interesting for me because I read it slowly and discussed it and we tried to figure out who was the killer.

I feel like this book made Mac a total girl boss. So, she's from an ultra rich family, but is still a self made millionaire. I was excited at first because I thought she knew how to code or something bc the reason why she made money is a social media platform. But, no, it was just and idea. That means she's really not self-made at all because how can you get read coders to take your business idea seriously if you don't have the family clout and capital in order to hire them. <br/><br/>It really wouldn't have been that much harder to change that about her but I guess being a girl who codes isn't that sexy. (it really could be tho) Additionally, one of the reasons why Preston is so bad is because he doesn't take her business venture seriously and once he actually found out that she made money for it he hated it. And she broke up with him. But, later when Cooper feels emasculated that Mac has all this money (which she is self-made) and he gets mad at her about it, that's not a total red flag. Like, realistic, yes, but also like you don't need him. <br/><br/>Men suck. Most of them can't handle it when their girl is more successful than them, and that was a huge plot line with the sexism of her family and her ex boyfriend. Then, actually have a real conversation with Cooper about it where he realizes it's okay rather than brushing it under the rug. Fr. Girl, you don't really need him. What is Cooper giving her that she can't have on her own. Just kinda ticked me off. Like we get it that tattooed bad boy who's masculine is so hot. Whatever, sure having an alpha guy is popular in romance books. But then it's a hard balance when the whole point is that Mac needs to be independent from her ex and family bc they're sexist.

I totally understand some of the criticisms this book has gotten. It really still feels YA, not adult. Due to the success of Chloe's previous books, she hasn't really improved as a writer and some of the styling feels repetitive. However, I still felt the book to be fast paced enough and overall felt intrigued and wanted to continue reading. <br/><br/>The fantasy aspect seems a little weak and she could have gone more in depth on the ethics and morals of jumping. I disagree with some of the criticisms about how jumping and using other bodies where there is no consent. I think that argument doesn't really make sense because in this fantasy world jumping is a thing and its allowed and it doesn't really make sense to put our moral expectations and compass to drive the book because then there would be no story here. The reality of this world is that jumping is normalized and it exists so the concept of one's bodily consent is much less clear. So to rate the book 1 star because of it confuses me.<br/><br/>Overall I still enjoyed the book. 3.5 stars rounded up because I will probably read the next book as the cliffhanger was a bit insane.",,,1,0,9781668000229,"nyt:hardcover-fiction=2023-08-06, New York Times bestseller"

I skipped the first book because it had lower reviews. I also am doing a buddy read/trade with my friend with another book in the series. So we are annotating and gifting to each other. I annotated this one for her. <br/><br/>I really liked this book a lot more than I expected myself to because the body guard trope is not a trope that I ever felt drawn too. I also generally have read too many Alpha male romances lately and a lot of the guys feel like they're the same. What made this book stand out to me was Bridget. I really liked her personality and her character development throughout the series. Rhys was like a plot device but she really was the main star. <br/><br/>Rhys himself is really not my type so I don't find myself attracted to him but he still got me to smile a couple times at his love for Bridget. I also really liked Huang's writing style in the book and her spicy scenes were well written and not overdone the way some of these other books can be. <br/><br/>I also genuinely enjoyed the main plot (outside of the romance) it was interesting. They mentioned Alex a couple times (The guy who's the main dude in book 1 of Twisted and he sounds a lot more my type so I might actually go and read the first Twisted book now even though it has lower ratings.) <br/><br/>Overall a solid 4 stars.

What I usually gravitate toward (and what I expect for a Dramione fanfic) is really really toxic, horrible, enemies to lovers. With a huge emphasis on the hate part. Like I expect them to hurt each other emotionally and physically for like half of the fanfic. On top of that, I expect a lot of outside conflict and internal conflict. <br/><br/>While Hermione and Draco suffer from some nightmares and PTSD, and Draco suffered from addiction, the overall flow of this story is very peaceful and happy. <br/><br/>Because this fanfic has over 300k words, it's still quite a slow burn. But at 19/51 chapters Draco and Hermione are kinda together and there's never really a falling out afterward like I expected there to be to create drama. Thus making this fanfic just really wholesome and with a ton of happy feels and warmth. <br/><br/>Even in the beginning, there's no enemies because at the start, Draco is already a great person. He's not racist, and he's incredibly apologetic and nice. They kinda go from strangers to friends to lovers. Although I wouldn't have picked up this fanfic had I known that in the beginning, I'm glad that I didn't know that this was just a wholesome cute love story because it really just make me feel happy. Though, I definitely want to read something really toxic next. <br/><br/>Also, can I freaking mention one of the hottest lines (section?) in the whole book with Draco talking about dessert holy shit I was SCREAMING. <br/><br/>The story definitely had a much stronger beginning and I loved the development between the characters in the beginning. I'd say maybe parts 75-90% of the story were really dragged out and would've benefited but being cut or shortened. <br/><br/><spoiler> Another thing that surprised me was how racist and frankly mean Narcissa was. I usually find that in these fanfics she tends to be supportive and not racist, but she was lowkey racist toward the end. I really wanted her to show up to their muggle wedding. :( </spoiler> <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed how sweet and wholesome this fic was. I probably won't read it again, but I'm glad that I read it. :)",,,2,0,,No ISBN

I also loved the tall women rep! 5 ft 11 inches lets go!! <br/><br/>The leading man, Charlie Lestra is pretty much perfection <3 I was swooning the whole time. Big fan. <br/><br/>My favorite part of this book, was although it was a romance, it puts heavy emphasis on the sister relationship between the main character and her younger, very different sister. It talked about the trauma from loosing their mom when they were young, and how it impacted their relationship. I loved the sisterly dynamics! It was really refreshing to have a 3rd character who is not the main two leads who is actually important to the storyline and adds something rather than just being background. <br/><br/>I personally couldn't relate much to the main character, but, I felt she was so similar to my older sister, who is tall, who lives in NYC and who is so similar to Nora. <br/><br/>The only thing I could slightly fault this book for was the miscommunication trope that created conflict.

And , yes, stem doesn't have much women in it, but biology is a pretty even field, if not more dominated by women. I checked out the stats myself, and at Stanford this past year, there are 92 Biology FEMALE Grad students and 82 Biology male grad students. This only ticked me off slightly because ECE is probably one of the field that women are most underrepresented in and I could only wish to have the ratios that biology has.",,,1,0,9780593336823,"American literature, New York Times bestseller, Romantic fiction, rom-com, romance, College Life, Women authors, women in STEM"

This was a really great book. I don't have a real rhyme or reason on why I give this 4/5 instead of 5/5. Maybe, I'll just say its a 4.5/5. <br/><br/>I liked Avery. I liked her a lot from the very 2nd page when she said, <br/> <blockquote>I had a habit of cutting things close. I walked the same tightrope with my grades: How little effort could I put in and still get an A? I wasn't lazy. I was practical. </blockquote><br/>I'm the same way... sadly, that's where the similarities between me and Avery end. Because, she is so much smarter, cooler, and stronger than I am. <br/><br/>The four Hawthorne brothers. Oh, what I could say about them. Let's start with the one I care least about: <br/><br/>Nash. Honestly, don't have much to say. He's whatever. Very side character. I don't see how he'll be important in the future yet, if at all. Next, <br/><br/>Xander. I like Xander, he's smart and nerdy and he just wants to feel included and be seen. I'm glad <spoiler> that he's the one with most of the information. I hope he doesn't stab Avery in the back though. </spoiler> <br/><br/>Now, how to talk about Jameson and Grayson separately? Personally, I like Grayson a lot more, so let's talk about Jameson first. <br/><br/>Jameson is so tricky, because I cannot tell what is going inside of his head. <spoiler> On the outside he seems so easy to read. He's hyper focused on the game, and he feels guilt toward Emily. He didn't really show real emotion toward Avery, at least not as far as we know. Then again, the story is written from her perspective. However, Grayson's line at the end of the novel. <br/><br/> <blockquote>""I will always protect you,"" he told me, his jaw tight, his eyes shadowed. ""You deserve to feel safe in your own home. And I'll help you with the foundation. I'll teach you what you need to know to take to this life like you were born to it. But this.. us.."" he swallowed. ""It can't happen, Avery. I've see the way Jameson looks at you."" He didn't say that he wouldn't let another girl come between them. He didn't have to. </blockquote><br/><br/>I think it's very clear, that Grayson has feelings toward Avery. And, I think, in the beginning, Avery had more feelings toward Jameson, but now she's redirected them toward Grayson. I am a sucker for gray eyed color boys. Also, Grayson is just a cooler name than Jameson, so I'm more inclined to like him that way. Shallow? Yes. Do I care? No. </spoiler> <br/><br/>Oops, ended up talking more about Grayson than Jameson in the Jameson part. So, here, non-spoilery things. I like Grayson the best and also he's hot. I want him to be happy. <spoiler> Emily played both these boys like a fiddle, and I believe both of them were equally hurt and pained by her. Maybe Grayson, a bit more. I don't want him to be hurt again, but if Grayson likes Avery, why should he let Jameson have her? I don't know. </spoiler> <br/><br/>I'm really excited about the next book... I'm going to go pre-order it now. I'm kinda upset I have to wait, but it's only like a month and a half.",,,1,0,9781368052405,"Children's fiction, nyt:young-adult-hardcover=2020-09-20, New York Times bestseller, Young adult fiction, social themes, class differences, Young adult fiction, romance, contemporary, Young adult fiction, thrillers & suspense, general, Young adult fiction, mysteries & detective stories"

So, it was really easy to read and very addicting. <br/><br/>I loved reading this Christmas romance in the middle of August because I miss the winter vibes.  I also didn't know it was going to take place in Park City. I lovee Park City, I lived there 7 months this past year, including the Christmas. I was totally trying to figure out all the places they were talking about, but I'm not sure all of them  quite existed.... either way, that's fine, I'm sure they couldn't name actual places anyway for slander or copyright something another. <br/><br/>Anyway, that's besides the point, the book was really cute. Did the time travel/ Groundhog day thing make any sense? Nope, but you just have to believe in Christmas miracles and you'll be fine. At first, Andrew felt a bit fake like he was just so perfectly responding to Maisie the entire time, and I was like this is kinda sus, he's toooo perfect, but I guess it wasn't sus after all and he's just amazing. <br/><br/>These contemporary romance novels are going to be the death of me because I now have standards for men that will never be achieved by any living man on  the planet haha. <br/><br/>Also, I loved Benny as a side character, he was honestly great.

I will make no further comments.<br/><br/>I also tabbed up and annotated this book like you cannot believe for my friend. I really am excited for her to read all my notes.

Bittersweet... more bitter than sweet. <br/>I'm crying. <br/>Holy crap. <br/>When was the last time I felt this emotional about something that I read. <br/><spoiler> the fact that I feel Snape was killed as a plot device and there could've been so much more done with his storyline. That would be the only flaw that I could find in this novel. </spoiler> <br/><br/>also its def not just 700 ish pages long. More like, 1400. <br/><br/>EDIT 7/10/2021: <br/><br/>Hi, I just reread this fanfic starting with the flashbacks and thus reading the story chronologically. After I finished reading the flashbacks and had to read from the beginning of the story when Hermione didn't have her memories I was sobbing. I couldn't even read it. I got stuck on chapter 3 and had to take a break for a couple hours because it was too painful. I didn't really think I would be so affected by it but it was so emotional. <br/><br/>There really is no other fanfic like Manacled. It's truly a beast of a story in the best way and everything about the thoughtfulness and the tiny details that you miss in the first part, that you can only understand having read the flashbacks first meant that the reread was so different than the first time I read it, and equally as painful. <br/><br/>The ending is just as bittersweet. It's crazy how as I was rereading, I still had hope for all these things that I wanted to happen (in a much more happily ever after type beat) but even though I knew what was going to happen I still couldn't stop myself from hoping. <br/><br/>ALSO i LITERLALY GOT THIS FANFIC BINDED INTO 3 SEPERATE PAPERBACK BOOKS BUT THEY'RE LEFT IN A DIFFERENT HOME THAN WHERE i AM THIS WHOLE SUMMER SO I REREAD IT ON AO3 AGAIN. <br/><br/>oh well that just means that I get to reread it again in physical copy version later. See you in 6 months when I realize that all other dramione fanfics are just not good and come back to this one again. <br/><br/><br/>Read here: <br/>https://archiveofourown.org/works/14454174/chapters/33390198",,,3,0,,No ISBN

Like really hard, and I just couldn't. I saw so many tiktoks saying that this was the most amazing book that they had read this year, that they had read this book 8 times, that people said it was life changing. So, I kinda had high expectations, but also didn't know what to expect. <br/><br/>All the top reviews are 5 stars. There are hardly any negative reviews. <br/><br/>As I started this book, I realized that the author used large vocabulary words and the writing was largely more complicated than your average YA book. So, I decided to google words I didn't know, and annotate the book. I read it slowly. I didn't skim. I wanted to give it the fairest shot possible so I could love it. <br/><br/>The premise was great.... the execution was... well what execution. As far as I can tell nothing really happened in this book. Sure, that's fine it's supposed to be super character driven... BUT I BARELY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANY OF THE CHARACTERS. <br/><br/>I'm really confused, and I don't know what's going on with anyone or anything... but also it was fairly somehow interesting. I'm not sure I think it took me over 10 hours of reading and over a week to read. IDK I just don't know. Maybe I'll have to revisit this in the future, because I want so badly to love it and I just don't. ",,,1,0,,No ISBN

The beginning had me a little bit irked. I felt as if the dynamics and writing of the characters of parachutes and ABC's and white students in LA high school didn't feel natural or realistic. I attributed this to the author's lack of going to a high school at high school age since she went to college at the age of 13. <br/><br/>However, as the book changed course into more serious topics of  predatory sexual assault and rape, the story got more engaging and horrifying. I felt as if the writing improved and felt more real. Sadly. (Because obviously rape and sexual assault is bad but the writing was so much better.) <br/><br/>I read the author's note at the end and can understand why her writing felt more realistic. I really hope that in the alternate universe of this book that Clair and Dani really do get justice for what happened. <br/><br/>I also hope that to the girls that this actually happens to in real life that eventually in society girls who get assaulted and raped can seek help instead of feeling shame for something that was not their fault. <br/><br/>This book overall had a good message and went in a direction that I did not expect, but was glad that it did.",,,1,0,9780062941084,"Young adult fiction, social themes, sexual abuse, Young adult fiction, social themes, emotions & feelings, Young adult fiction, social themes, emigration & immigration, New York Times reviewed"

However, there was so much more development in the world and premise of the story that I am excited to see play out in the rest of the series. <br/><br/>Ngl, Magnus really do be falling for Cleo but then is like ""ew gross the only woman I love is my sister."" Like chill dude, I know that y'all ain't related by blood but you grew up thinking you were and like you should be happy that you're falling for someone who isn't your sister. <br/><br/>I like Jonas' character a lot and lowkey ship him with Cleo more than I do Magnus. I feel as this is different from my thoughts before because I knew I used to like Magnus a lot more 5 years ago than I am on this reread. <br/><br/>Also why is this book so much more violent than I remember like so many people are getting murdered and killed it's so crazy. Like I like these characters and then bamidy wam bam they're dead and I'm like wtf. <br/><br/>Not really a 5/5 star read but close enough so I won't change my rating.

And it was pretty enjoyable to read. <br/><br/>My youngerself would've enjoyed this book far more than I did but there were a bunch of little things that threw me off. <br/><br/>For one, the very beginning with descriptions of the characters. It was so laughable of how gorgeous she used to be. And ofc Dorian has those startling blue eyes and the ""raven-black hair"" like every other male lead in a YA romance. <br/><br/>There were some things that irked one; one being they always talk about how she is so terrifying, and murderous. How she did all these things in her past that proved her to be the BEST assassin, to have no heart. But, there is 0 proof in this entire novel. She doesn't do anything. Action speaks louder than words. Don't tell us that she is such a badass and give us no proof that she is. Also, I don't care if she was trained in extreme and horrible conditions from ages 8-14. She is an underweight skinny average height female who is 18. It would not be easy for her to beat a 250 pound 6ft+ super trained male solider. <br/><br/>In fact the one time she was shown to struggle, in the first test <spoiler> she can barely stay in the middle of the pack and throws up at the end. That's prob the only test she should have an advantage in. She's underweight but must have stamina from working in those conditions for a year. So she should be good at going a long distance of running. All those super muscley men should have it harder to lug their muscles for a long time. All long distance runners are lean as hell. I felt like there wasn't a lot of research in the book. </spoiler> <br/><br/>Despite my critiques, the book was still pretty enjoyable to read and that's why I gave it 3 stars. I still had a good time reading it and I want to continue with the series. <br/><br/>Another thing though, <spoiler> the romance with Dorian was like so weird? Like it was kinda insta lust because they never really spent time together. Though I liked him and was upset when she just broke things off with him at the end. And for what? Her reasons didn't make a lot of sense. But I suppose in order to have a love triangle they have to give Chaol a fighting shot in the next book. </spoiler> <br/><br/>Also, I really liked Nox's character I'm sad that he left he was pretty cool and I wish we could learn more about him.",,,1,0,,No ISBN

However, it just didn't live up to my expectations. The plot was weak as well as the Dramione aspect. I don't know why it's a cult classic Dramione fic. My emotions never felt destroyed and I didn't cry.<br/><br/>I also felt like a lot of characters just didn't make sense. So many death eaters defect and betray Voldemort. Why? We are really not given much explanation. Draco also says twice in the book that his idea on blood purity hasn't changed and he still believes purebloods are superior to muggle borns but that he just doesn't think muggle borns should be treated as slaves. Like okay? That was his view at the beginning and his view at the end. <br/><br/>Essentially, falling in love with Hermione did nothing to Draco's development as a character. He never changed, never grew. Even Hermione didn't really either, all she does is just get better mentally a bit and then forgive literally everyone who has hurt her. <br/><br/>The people who hurt her for YEARS all of a sudden just become better people for NO reason. Pansy just heals all of the scars she gave Hermione. Why? There's no way that would've happened. Also Lucius Malfoy at the end? What made him change? Literally nothing. What he did to Hermione was awful and horrible and it wasn't properly addressed how he just became a good person and why he was so readily forgiven. And worst of all, Rulphous's love toward Hermione. What the hell happened to him at the end there. It was like the author couldn't figure out how to get Hermione out of that situation so she decided to pull a super fast one and change his character so much. IDK I've read a lot of Dramione fanfics that were mind-blowing and amazing and this just wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>For being the longest fanfic I've ever read (Literally the length of half the entire Harry Potter original works) there was little to no character development and the plot was meh at best.

I never knew what would happen!!!  <br/><br/>This is very likely one of my top favorites series, and definitely the best duology I've read ever!  <br/><br/>RECOMMEND 100%%<br/><br/>Reread in Jan 2019 and I've decided this is my favorite series of all time.<br/><br/>EDIT APRIL 18,2021:<br/><br/>(I actually listened to the audiobook with this reread and it was fantastic! I love the new dimension it gave to the story and cleared up so many pronunciation errors I had.) <br/><br/>Where do I even begin with this third reread? This book is incredible. It's hard to say if it's better than Six of Crows or not. Either way, it's no question that this duology is my favorite book series of all time, with the debate of my singular favorite book of all time being either this one or the first one. The character development in Kaz, Inej, Jesper, Wylan, and Matthias is incredible. I know I didn't name Nina, but I think she'll be getting more development in the King of Scars duology. Her character's arc in these two books is the weakest, but she's still amazing and I love Nina all the same. <br/><br/>The Matthias hate train needs to stop. Who who could hate him? <spoiler> That last chapter, 38, with him shows his incredible growth immensely. Even though it was my third reread, I still cried. </spoiler> <br/><br/>One of my favorite lines from this book is in the front half when Inej says to Kaz. <br/><br/> <blockquote>""He was going to break my legs,"" she said, her chin held high, the barest quaver in her voice. ""Would you have come for me then, Kaz? When I couldn't scale a wall or walk a tightrope? When I wasn't the Wraith anymore?""<br/>...<br/>""I would come for you,"" he said, and when he saw the wary look she shot him, he said it again. ""I would come for you. And if I couldn't walk, I'd crawl to you, and no matter how broken we were, we'd fight our way out together-knives drawn, pistols blazing. Because that's what we do. We never stop fighting."" </blockquote><br/>That really broke me. It was the first time Kaz accepted that he cared. Really cared about Inej. <br/><br/>I could go on and on about all my favorite moments since I actually tabbed up this book (A rarity, I know) so I know where all my favorite moments are. But, I'm not so eloquent and don't want to accidently spoil something real. <br/><br/>I need to also give kudos to Jesper and Wylan. I actually find Jesper's character to be so unique because he's the only one of the Six that actually has a parent. A loving parent who's there with him. I just love how Bardugo is able to create such a diverse cast of characters in terms of culture, background, ability, weaknesses, talent,  and personality. Yet, each one is just as rich as they are by the end of the novel. <br/><br/>I love this duology more than I can ever express and I hope to reread it again when Six of Crows book 3 comes out. :))",,,3,0,,No ISBN

And the character development for her mom, although progressive and nice to see, did feel a bit unrealistic. <br/><br/>I also wanted to love the romance, but Darren was absent for most of the book so I didn't really care that much.

Amazing. <br/><br/>This finale was incredible. The first two books kinda felt like world building and plot building but this book is where the shit happened. It had me hooked from the first couple pages and I read it through to finish it was 2am even though I had an early morning class. <br/><br/>The plot twists and turns fucked me up, man. <br/><br/><spoiler> The deaths really made me sad. I didn't think that Callum was going to die. He just wanted everyone to have peace and be happy. Honey Bee's death was also shocking. Honestly, I was shocked where her character went. In the first two books the anarchists don't seem to be that villainous. But, they're also technically in retirement. We see everything from Nova's point of view and she's never known them during the war. She's only known them for after. Clearly, she hadn't expected them to be so terrible. And when Honey tried to murder Nova wtf. I'm glad Leroy was more reasonable. <br/><br/>THE FACT THAT ACE ANARCHY ACTUALLY KILLED NOVA'S FAMILY. Jeez. Her entire motivation for hating the Renegades was a lie. <br/><br/>And the epilogue where we get hinted that Magpie is probably Nova's little sister, Evie. Damn. Wish that would be confirmed. </spoiler><br/><br/>What I really liked is that in this book, in the beginning the Renegades also gets villainized. They aren't the best organization. There isn't a clear good side and an evil side so we really sympathize with Nova's character as she remains conflicted to which side she should stay loyal to.   <br/><br/>I'm really glad I stuck it out in the kinda slower first two books because this last book was 100% worth it.",,,1,0,9781250078384,"Children's fiction, Science fiction, Adventure and adventurers, fiction, nyt:series-books=2019-11-24, New York Times bestseller"

Goodbye.<br/><br/>EDIT APRIL 7, 2021<br/><br/>I try to write my reread reviews before I read my old reviews in order not to influence myself with my old self. Honestly, this book is still good. I really enjoyed it. I didn't cry this time around, and I don't feel as if I was as attached as I was before, but it was still really good. <br/><br/>It was heartbreaking at some points. One of the best quotes is when the Darkling says: ""I will strip away all that you know, all that you love, until you have no shelter but me."" Yeah. I don't know why that makes me feel things. I shouldn't. The first time around I was undoubtfully in love with the Darkling from the beginning. <br/><br/>This time, it took me a while, I am older and more mature and felt his toxicity in the first book, but still he grew on me and by this book I was still shipping him and Alina. Moreso, I think the story would be so interesting if Alina did choose the darkling. I've never read a book about a main character who CHOOSES to go to the bad side. I hope someone writes an incredibly well written fanfiction one day where Alina chooses the Darkling either sometime in Siege and Storm or near the beginning of Ruin and Rising. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm glad to have finished this.

Rowan wasn't some skinny girl with soft brown hair and Niel wasn't some 6 ft hot guy. Rowan had a pear shaped body and not ""western ideals"" for her features because she had a bump on her nose. Niel was short. At 5'5"" that makes him probably one of the shortest male love interests I have ever read about ever and he was a red head covered in freckles. They also, even being the top students in their grade, are going to NYU and Emerson which are both fantastic colleges but I'm glad they didn't both go to Harvard or Stanford or something. <br/><br/>The dynamics and writing just made me fall in love with the characters because even though they don't represent me, a half white half asian girl who's in stem, they did represent people who were normal and realistic.

That was around 10 years ago? <br/><br/>Now, I'm a sophmore in college and I decided I want to reread this series after watching the first season of the TV show Alex Rider on Amazon Prime. I didn't remember a lot about the series, but I did remember that they kinda skipped the first book in the TV show. <br/><br/>Stormbreaker is a good start to this series. I stand by rating it 4 stars as I did 5 years ago when I created my goodreads and rated this book by memory. If I read this book for the first time now, I'd probably feel more inclined to rate it 3 stars. There are a lot of unrealistic things about this book, but mainly that's just the premise and nothing can be faulted for that. I mean come on, Alex Rider is a 14 year old spy for MI6. What do you expect? <br/><br/>I still enjoyed reading the book and it was a fun read. It totally feels like an episode of Totally Spies with the gadgets that Smithers gives Alex and how they end up being useful later on in the book. It's a good start. <br/><br/>Also, I'm 19 now and I'm no where near as cool as Alex is at 14 in the first book ahaaha oh well that's to be expected. I remember reading this when I was a kid and assuming that I would be that cool when I became 14. Oh, how I would've disappointed my 10 year old self if she could see me now. <br/><br/>Anyway, long overdue tangent that isn't even part of a review... I will be continuing to read this series.

Maas is not that good at writing the beginnings of books. Much like Crown of Midnight, the first half was quite a drawl and the second half picked up quite a bit. Though I do prefer books that get better as you read rather than books that get worse as you read. <br/><br/>Celeana's character still confuses me as I feel she is not one character. Actually the books quite feel like each one was written by a different author who had a grasp of each character slightly different and wrote them that way. <br/><br/>It took a while for anything to <spoiler> happen with her training with Rowan, who I disliked at first but he's growing on me as a character even if he reminds me of Edward Cullen mixed with Jacob. I also thought it was weird that he like NEEDED to be bonded to her by blood oath so quickly after escaping Maeve's like couldn't he wait an hour like think it through at all?? he's like a bazillion years old you think he's be smarter with impulsive decisions. </spoiler><br/><br/>The witch girl chapters were a BORE I skimmed through them so fast because I just wanted to know what was happened to the other characters. <br/><br/><spoiler> POOR DORIAN omg he like finally is loving this girl and being happy and she gets fucking AXED and he gets a fucking slave collar put on him omg no I feel so bad for him he's such a sweetheart and deserves so much better </spoiler> <br/><br/>Also like Chaol, I just don't like him. I don't dislike him either but he reminds me of Jason from PJO. Idk he's just kinda boring. <br/><br/>Then there's Aedion I didn't know what the think of his character in the first 3/4 of the book but he grew on me as well.  <br/><br/>It's actually hard for me to rate this 3 or 4 stars. There was a lot I had problems with and thought were quite boring but I also really liked the end fight scene so I don't know if that makes up for it.

The set up before the action is very repetitive and I wish it would pick up. <br/><br/>The second half was so much better than the first half and I'm finally warming up to Manon's character. <br/><br/>Aedion and Rowan being territorial animals for Aelin is quite frankly uncomfortable. I dislike it a lot. The romance between her and Rowan also makes me uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Chaol... what happened to his character? He was kinda boring before, but at least he was consistent. It's like in this book his personality did a 180. I simply do not understand why he hated Aelin so much and why the entire time he thought she was a lying murderous bastard. Okay like to be fair she kinda is but that's my personal opinion. That was not Chaol's opinion. <br/><br/>Also, Aelin is like... her character is kinda confusing idk I'm not sure I like her. <br/><br/>I do like Lysandra a lot actually and the female friendship that she and Aelin had was refreshing. <br/><br/><spoiler> Arobynn's death was just disappointing. His character is so talked about and put on a pedestal of how he is so cruel and amazing. Everyone is afraid of him including Aelin and the King. Yet, his death is so bland. After so much build up I really expected a grand fight, and Arobynn was supposed to win. He was so conniving and manipulative and I really wanted something more. He was so interesting too and now that he's gone its like meh. <br/><br/><br/>Also, the king being a valg prince too wtf man.   </spoiler><br/><br/>tbh wtf is this whole book and series I always have so many issues and complain so much but like I still enjoyed it so that's why it's 3 stars. And I am too invested not to finish the series.

The premise and set up of this book was amazing, and I read it so quickly. I actually really appreciate that this is a YA book with a strong female character who is NOT a warrior (in the fighting sense). Usually in fantasy, the main character has powers that allow them to be amazing fighters, but there's none of that in this book and it was quite refreshing. <br/><br/>I really really love Edan and enjoyed the enemies to lovers trope a lot. Although, in the 2nd half it did get a bit too sappy sometimes. Maia and Edan were still super cute together and I ship it a lot :)) <br/><br/>I thought Maia's character had a lot of development throughout the novel as she had more experiences and became stronger. However, I didn't feel as if Edan's character was as fleshed out as it could've been. Hopefully he gets more growth in the next book.   ",,,1,0,,No ISBN

I'm so excited!! 4 years later and I'm a struggling college sophmore. Hopefully this book makes me less stressed lol<br/><br/>Review (October 13, 2020): <br/><br/>I finally finished this book (although is finishing a book only like a week after it's released actually slow? anyway) <br/><br/>If I'm being honest this was not my favorite Percy Jackson / Heroes of Olympus / Trials of Apollo book. Do not get me wrong, I still rated it 5 stars and I loved it so much! I'm so happy that we were able to see more of Will and Nico together and I thought that the way that Rick Riordan ended this series was very satisfactory. <br/><br/>I love Apollo and Meg's dynamic of an older brother younger sister relationship. Apollo cares for her greatly and the way that Rick Riordan deals with the topic of an abusive and manipulative father is incredibly well done in a way that still makes it digestible for young children. Although I did not grow up in such a terrible home, Meg's own individual personality outside of what she had to go through reminds me so much of myself when I was 12. <br/><br/>As I read this series, I felt as if I was reading a character that represented my younger self, and when I was younger most characters I read about were people that I wanted to be. People that were so cool and amazing. But Meg is not a typical main character in a middle grade book and I just connected with her so much throughout the series. Not really sure where I was going with this... just wanted all my thoughts written down. <br/><br/>I feel like a piece of my childhood is dead though since there is no more after this.... (OR IS THEREEEEEE) <spoiler> like near the end Nico and Will's story line was clearly set up that they could have an entire series revolved around them. Like everyone else's story lines were wrapped up in a nice little bow except theirs. I would be soooo excited if we had a series on Nico and Will omg they're literally the CUTEST I love them so much. </spoiler> <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this book and it gave me so many feels. I'm sad to say that it's over. I grew up on these books and they made me love reading. How could it come to an end?

I finished this book last night and cried myself to sleep and this morning I'm still freaking out. It's actually been a really long time since I've felt this way about a book and I'm just so shocked.  <br/><br/><spoiler> When we met Piper and we found out that her and Jason had broken up, I was surprised, but happy that not every single OTP of kids at age 14 that got together, stayed together. I found it really realistic but I seriously thought that they would get back together by the end of the book. I had no doubts that they would fall back in love and kiss and be happy. <br/><br/>In addition, the prophecy saying that either Piper or Jason would die, I thought that was kinda fake. Like maybe for middle grade kids to think that someone would die but then nobody would REALLY die, like the word would mean something different. But, then, Jason did die. And in the most unspectacular way as well. I thought it was fake. Apollo's sarcastic narration made me not believe it until the end when Leo comes back and asks where Jason is and then I knew it was true and I started crying. <br/><br/>Jason was the first main character that Rick Riordan killed. In the OG PJO series, he killed many side character and those deaths hurt, but not that badly because nobody was main. And in the HOO series, I can't even remember anyone who died, even though I think most fans were expecting one of the 7 to die. I can't believe that Jason went through all of that. The great prophecy of the 7 literally defeating mother earth and to die in a book as a side character LESS THAN A YEAR LATER (in the book world) from a stupid fake not even a god. <br/><br/>I just never expected it. I didn't think it was possible and I'm really upset. If this was Rick's way of trying to get more fans to like Jason Grace, it probably worked. He was my least favorite character in HOO, like many other people. So he was probably the safest bet for killing. If piper had died, I think there would have been much more of a riot. <br/></spoiler> <br/><br/>This book might be my favorite book in the PJO universe by far. The plot was interesting and complex. Apollo is a great narrator and Meg is seriously GROWING on me.  I'm really glad I'm going to finish this series and close the childhood chapter in my life with a bang. This book made me feel emotions that I hadn't felt in a long time. Congrats Uncle Rick, you're still going strong. I was worried a bit during the Magnus Chase books. (I didn't like those) haha okay bye still so upset.",,,1,0,9781368024129,Not Found

Once again the beginning 200ish pages were boring af it took me 3 weeks to eat them. But, after that things picked up and I was able to finish the last 500 pages in two Days. <br/><br/>The cast of characters is larger now (and at times I feel it is too large. Especially toward the end) and I’ve really grown to like Manon a lot in this book. I also really like Dorian and Fenrys. (Fenrys is def my favorite ""new"" character in this novel. <br/><br/>Omg I’m so glad there’s no Chaol in this book cuz I dislike his character. So I’m not really looking forward to tower of dawn. Like I actually think this book is my favorite so far because Chaol was not in it. I feel like everyone really like Chaol but I seriously never did. But enough about him, he's not even in this book. <br/><br/>Omg the Rowan and Aelin sex scenes were soooo uncomfyyyy and also funny. The metaphors are hilarious and all the nibbling and biting is not it. Also just in general I'm super confused at the tone of this book vs the others. It seems that every single down time the characters have, or really any time they are not literally fighting, they're having sex now. While having these scenes in a book don't bother me, it does bother me that readers do not know what they are getting into. For the first 5 books in the series (I'm including the prequel"") they have sorta mentioned it but it has never been this graphic. And for a book that is modeled for YA, I think it's not right. Since 13 year old kids can read 5 books and then get hit with this??? <spoiler> AND ON THE FUCKING BEACH are you kidding me. Sand gets everywhere. Everywhere. bruh just why. <br/><br/>Also the comment that Dorian makes about how it doesnt matter if manon is a witch as long as she has female genitalia its all the same??? dude not cool that was not a cool line. I've read other reviews and they think that Manon shouldve been gay and I def agree like the Dorian Manon thing is a little forced.  </spoiler><br/><br/><br/>Lysandra is a beastttt (pun intended) I love her she’s awesome and I'm glad we were able to explore her character more. Her and Aedion. First of all why does every single slightly main character have to be paired up with someone. And throwing it out in 3 lines that Aedion is bisexual but then he's going to be with a girl anyway seemed lame. like SJM only put those lines in so she could claim she had diversity. But yeah why can't people just be independent and single. but...<br/><br/>along those lines, I do think that Lorcan and Elide are cutee. In the beginning I was lowkey super sus about it since I had always thought that Elide was a literal CHILD like I thought she was like 13 years old and when Lorcan said she was attractive and lookin at her amazing boobs i was like uhhh but turns out shes like 18/19 so i guess it's chill? <br/><br/>The ending was a little big rushed as they tried to set up the final book I think. But it seems pretty chill I guess. <spoiler> like near the end just bringing in all those desert ppl from the novella story and stuff like it was all too rushed and now we have SO MANY CHARACTERS it's a little hard to care about so many people because they're insignificant to me but then I feel like I'm supposed to care and I just dont. <br/><br/>I loved the scene with Maeve and the entire show down there it was the best part of the entire book. The way that Maeve is just absolutely cruel perfection. Except the thing about the releasing Lorcan and Aedion's dad from the blood oath like? I felt that was just plot magic like we needed stronger ppl on the Aelin gang so it was done under the guise of making them feel shame for all eternity or something but like its def a good thing so idk why she didnt just keep them as slaves or kill them. Anything for the plot to move in favor I guess. <br/><br/>ALSO ROWEN AND AELIN ARE MATES AND GOT MARRIED bruh okay dude i guess aelin is a genius who knew everything was gonna happen so she told lysandra that shed have to become aelin and shit and rowen needed to be married so he could be the air and Aelin just sacrificed herself like that and for what idk idk it was interesting i guess but I dont like it when we read all this boring ass shit of what characters are doing in real time and then later find out something craazy happened cuz Aelin is just a fucking genius. idk the writing is annoying at timessssss</spoiler><br/><br/>Overall it started out slow and picked up. But even then, the middle parts were just so long. This book didn’t need to be 700 pages it could’ve easily been 450 and been just as complete and probably better in my opinion. I’m too invested in the story and I need to know the ending but thinking about reading 700 pages about Chaol makes me sad. And the final book being 1000 pages is a little intimidating. Hopefully I finish the series.<br/><br/>So you might ask with all my fucking ranting about everything that I dislike how is this book 4 stars????? BECAUSE IT STILL ENTERTAINS ME AND I AM INVESTED AND WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ENDING DESPITE THE FACT THAT SO MUCH OF THE SERIES HAS ME WANTING TO QUITTTTTT.<br/><br/>no im not okay ",,,1,0,9781619636095,"Magic, YA, Quest, High Fantasy, Fiction, Romance, Fantasy, Royalty, Court, Assassins, JUVENILE FICTION / Love & Romance, Juvenile fiction, JUVENILE FICTION / Action & Adventure / General, Kings, queens, rulers, Love, JUVENILE FICTION / Fantasy & Magic, Queens, Children's fiction, Fantasy fiction, Kings, queens, rulers, etc., fiction, Love, fiction, collectionID:EanesChallenge, [series:Throne_of_Glass]"

I thought the author captured the asian bay area teenage vibe perfectly. I thought the characters were realistic and fun.<br/><br/>There are a lot of bad reviews for this book because they say that Dimple is a shitty person but honestly she seems incredibly realistic. Like, sure, she's ""not like other girls"" because she hates makeup and says some negative things about girls who wear super booty shorts or follow other humanities/arts stuff. However, it makes a lot of sense to me. <br/><br/>As a girl who was raised in a bay area asian household, I had a lot of the same types of expectations as Rishi. My parents raised me to only care about math grades and look at art/music/reading as purely hobbies. As well as makeup being a waste of time etc. I had a lot of negative thoughts on a lot of feminine things because I actually did have an inclination to stem subjects. I think that <br/>Dimple having a little bit of internalized misogyny toward feminine things makes her character a well-rounded and realistic character. I think that makes the book better imo. I felt I could relate to her a lot and I understood a lot of what she was going through. I did wish they focused more on the coding aspect of the story, but the novel is a romance so it makes sense. Also, reading a story about coding is kinda boring cuz if I wanted to read about coding then why wouldn't I just code instead. <br/><br/>Anyway, I feel like the hate doesn't really make sense for this book. Another thing people say is that the romance is toxic because Dimple is super controlling to Rishi and doesn't let him have any input on the coding project or the dance. Which like totally makes sense. Rishi literally does NOT care about Insominia con at all. He went because he wanted to meet Dimple and was more than happy to leave because she wasn't interested. While Insomnia con is Dimple's dream. Ofc she can call all the shots?? like I really didn't see how that was toxic at all idk <br/><br/>Overall I just really enjoyed this book and it was nice reading a YA contemporary with a character that I could relate to.

Celeana is a badass. But her character is sometimes written to conflict that still. The first half was very reminent of the first book but it greatly improved throughout the novel. I enjoyed the 2nd half of the book a lot. Not quite a 5 star book perhaps 4.3 stars. <br/><br/>I don't particularly like Chaol I have to be honest I still like Dorian far more.<br/><br/><spoiler> I was sad when Nehemia died because I really liked her character however I had been spoilt for it before by a tik tok. Also, I really liked how she killed Grave and later Archer. That was so fucking amazing. Tricking Archer like that and then him thinking that he was going to let her live before stabbing him. Beautiful. However, I wonder if she wasn't so infatuated with Chaol and Dorian by friendship would she have left Archer alive and such. What he was saying MADE sense. When she pretended to be on his side it MADE sense. </spoiler><br/><br/>I feel this book's biggest flaw is writing an inconsistent main character. When Celeana is badass I love her character. I love that she finally inst afraid to kill. However, she sometimes slips back into that ""quirky"" I'm not like other girls because I eat loads of chocolate cake it it just doesn't make sense. I hope those inconsistencies in her character are fixed in the future. I want a badass and I understand they can be feminine and fall in love and have romance. But to be a carefree ditz is not in the job description.

Everything at all so reading this book had me just as surprised and shocked as the first time I read it exactly 5 years ago. <br/><br/>I'm 19 years old now and I'm a college student, but this book had me sobbing just as hard as when I was 14. I literally took pauses near the end to scream because I couldn't believe what was happening. <spoiler> Sanguine's sacrifice for Tanith was my favorite and least favorite thing that happened. I loved him so much this time and he was one of my favorite characters maybe actually 2nd after Skulduggery. His story and personality was honestly amazing and I loved having a character who was clearly not good but still had redeeming qualities.  He died for Tanith, the woman he loved, even though she didn't have any positive feelings to return to him. He was always one of the most selfish characters in the book but he really stepped up. He had the god killer dagger and he died with a triumphed smile on his face thinking he killed the black cleaver.  Probably unpopular but his dead hurt far more than Ghastly's did. And when he died, Tanith felt something in her heart deep down and that hurt me really bad. Sanguine never even got to tell the real Tanith that he loved her. Because after she came back from her senses he respected and cared about her too much to tell her that they were fiances together and said they were just friends. It honestly hurts so much.</spoiler><br/><br/><br/>In addition the plan was just soooo good that they had come up with. <spoiler> I was sad that the Melamcholia died fighting with them and Solemon Wreath's death was so simple yet uneventful. Such big characters kicked the bucket so hard. I know some of them were implied to be dead like Dexter Vex but later he actually turns out to not be dead which is almost a shame. Derek Landy is one of the cruelest of authors. </spoiler><br/><br/>And don't even get me started on <spoiler> Stephanie. Yeah she was kinda a little shit in the beginning when she tried to kill valkyrie and she did kill carol. But she developed actual feelings. Her relationship with Fletcher was a little weird I have to be honest. I feel so terrible for the dude though. First he dates Valkyrie and she becomes Darquesse and then he dates Stephanie who dies and BECOMES DARQUESSE. Honestly the trend might just be whoever he dates is terrible cuz REMEMBER HIS AUSTRALIAN GIRFRIEND WAS A FUCKING KILLER TOO holy shit the boy deserves such a good life. They would not have won so many battles if not for him. </spoiler><br/><br/>ALSO <spoiler>I LOVE VALKYRIE'S CHARACTER! she is not some super good person who can't do anything difficult and hard. She killed her baby sister to get the septre (and yeah was able to bring her back but she didn't know that it would work) on top of that the septre didn't even end up being a super big deal in the final battle.  </spoiler><br/><br/>I love this book series with all my heart and it has hurt me in so many ways that I can't even describe. I now know that there is a continuation of the series and that it isn't the end but I have heard that it is not the best. I think I'll give it a shot with low expectations. I'm just worried that they might ruin my childhood and this amazing series that actually ended.  <br/><br/>Skulduggery Pleasant 1-9 is my favorite book series of all time and I cannot fully describe how it has hurt me in the best way. I'm glad I was able to read such a work of masterpiece. I wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars. <br/><br/>I do disagree with what I said before which this is the best book in the series. The last 1/3 of the book may be the best section of the book written, however, my favorite book is book 8, the Last Stand of the Dead men. That book overall was just a tad bit better. I think book 9 had a slightly slow start. <br/><br/><br/><br/>ORIGINAL JULY 25, 2015 REVIEW: <br/>I am currently crying into an every growing large pool of tears.  <br/><br/>This book deserves a billion stars it was so good.  <br/><br/>Derek Landy, you are cruel.  <spoiler> Making us think that Skulduggery died and then switching back to the story about Danny, which was in the future, and then having Valkyrie joke about how he pushed Ravel into the accelerator.  Pure evil as an author, but one of the best authors ever as well. </spoiler><br/><br/>The last 70 pages of this book, I was constantly crying, a heavy flow of tears falling from my eyes.  My heart is in shambles, and this probably makes no sense what so ever.  But that is cool. <br/><br/><spoiler> Sanguine.  He was a good bad guy. The best bad guy.  I loved his character so much.  And when he died, for Tanith, by the black cleaver it was too much.  I cannot believe it.  Tanith then feels things deep in her heart when she sees his dead body, as if her heart can remember all the nice and loving things that Sanguine did for her when she had a remnant in her.  She can't remember, but her heart sure does.  She lost Ghastly and now Sanguine is gone too.  </spoiler><br/><br/>This is how I was feeling <br/><img src = ""http://media2.giphy.com/media/z18p1Aw2R4qnm/giphy.gif""><br/><img scr = ""https://38.media.tumblr.com/8df51b7bc15260c793700214f9db20ec/tumblr_mrx2sfAk0B1r7j0xho1_500.gif""><br/><img src = ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/giphygifs/media/UntJ0NdEKEZry/giphy.gif""><br/><br/>There are so many things that I could talk about right now, but all the thoughts are running around in my brain, and I can't think straight. <br/><br/>This was in no way a happy ending.  And the ending that Derek Landy made us think that was going on, was even worse.  But I think that this was a ""perfect"" end to a nine book series.  It was not a disappointment, and the best book in the series. <br/><br/>Why is there no more Skulduggery Pleasant???<br/><br/>WHAT WILL I DO WITH MY LIFE NOW?!<br/><br/>First things first, I need to stop crying.  But I will never forget this story, which has become one of my favourite book series of all times, maybe even better than Harry Potter.  <br/><br/><img src = ""https://38.media.tumblr.com/8032bd1d0a027b996883bf76b957534d/tumblr_ndts04bXxT1sow7meo1_500.gif""><br/><br/>I hope I don't drown.<br/>",,,2,0,9780007489251,"Skulduggery Pleasant (Fictitious character), Wizards, Magic, Juvenile fiction, Children's fiction, Fantasy fiction, Fiction, Fantasy, Stephanie (Fictitious character : Landy), Teenage fiction, Child and youth fiction"

I actually got sad when Tanith killed Jack because it was quiet cruel and we've known his character pretty long. I actually really like Dusk's character and it answers why the other old vampire dies in Last Stand Of The Dead Man because he was the one that killed Dusk. I hope I get to see more of him in the later books 10-13 that I haven't read yet. </spoiler> Overall it was an awesome side story. I really liked Tanith's backstory as a kid.

This is by far the best book in the series so far and I was freaking out.  The same things shocked me because although I knew  <spoiler> Ghastly died from memory I had forgotten how and so the betray of ravel killing shudder and ghastly was just as surprising and shocking as when I read it five years ago.</spoiler> I still agree that I'm not sure that this should be rated for 11 year olds haha.  The descriptions are far more gruesome in this book than previous and I love every second of it.  This book series is entertaining to college age ppl too. Also, I'm still debating if I should continue after the 9th book (where I stopped before) because the 10-13 books dont have the best reviews and with this book being so good and I know the 9th one is awesome too, I'm not sure I want to ruin the world of skullduggery and ruin my childhood favorite book series.

I couldn't connect with any of the characters and the situations all seemed too... perfectly planned out.   <br/><br/>The main character was a complete push over,  and the other characters walked all over her and it seemed to get worse as the story progressed.  Dax didn't seem mysterious to me,  rather flat and rude.   Jeff was just too perfect,  I honestly don't understand it.   <br/><br/>The book was still highly entertaining.

No matter what, even when he was being beaten to death or about to be hanged, he always had some insult to say to the enemy that made me laugh.

This book had me smiling and squealing so many times.  I just wanted the love interests to get together so badly.  Sure, it was a little cliche, but that's exactly what we need. Books now all try to be different with different tragedies, illnesses, and sexual preferences. (Not that I'm against those.) But it was really nice to finally read the classic girl vs boy, hate or love? Story again.  Plus, Kasie added her own twist and makes all the characters, even the side ones, have full personalities and barely any are cardboard cutouts.  I really enjoyed this book, I read it on an airplane in an hour it was fabulous. ",,,1,0,9780545850971,"Children's fiction, Emotions, fiction, Dating (social customs), fiction, Schools, fiction, Composition (Music), Juvenile fiction, Fiction, Emotions in adolescence, Sexual attraction, Music, Dating (Social customs), High schools, Schools"

I was shocked.  I had no idea the America was still so sexist.  I asked why. <br/>My mother said it was because it sucks when people hear 100 soldiers dead.  But it's worse to hear 100 Women dead.  I was perplexed.  I told her, there was no difference in my eyes, and my mother said it was good to think that way, but most people don't.  <br/><br/>This book showed racism and sexism that would have existed during that time and didn't go overboard with feminism.  There are some things girls just can't be on equal footing with guys, like strength because of males simply have more testosterone.  But, in terms of skill and intelligence, Grant portrayed a story in which not only did our main characters overcome the prejudice, they were damn good at being equal or even better in a few areas.  <br/><br/>I recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a twist on World War II.",,,1,0,9780062342157,"Women soldiers, Juvenile fiction, World War, 1939-1945, Children's fiction, Soldiers, fiction, War, fiction"

However, I really enjoyed it.  Except the ending needed to be like 25 pages longer to wrap everything up.  <br/><br/>Gabrielle Zevin, in my opinion, has a really nice writing style.  From the first page, it's just so easy to read and get into the story.  I feel like I'm part of the story and all her characters are my characters.  Everything just flows so nicely.  The characters all feel real.  <br/><br/>Let's talk about Naomi.  I liked Naomi.  Her personality and just the way she dealt with everything going on in her life.  Yeah, there were a few decisions that I thought were stupid, but she dealt with the consequences quite realistically.  <br/><br/>I like Will.  He's quirky, passionate, and fun to read about.  He has a clear goal, yearbook and I totally understand why he reacted the way he did.  After all, Naomi was being a bit selfish.  <br/><br/>James.  I disliked James ever since it said he smoked.  Smoking is a turn off and I didn't like him as the love interest the moment we got to know a little about him.  Which is kind of ironic because one of his fears is that people will dislike him because of his past.  <br/><br/>Ace was a typical jock, but nicer than expected near the end. <br/><br/>It was also interesting to read about the other side characters like Alice, Naomi's dad and mom, and Rosa Rivera.  They all had such distinct personalities even though they didn't have to have one.  I thought it was nice that all the characters were well rounded in this novel.

Realistically it should be two stars with the amount of unoriginal ideas there were in this story.  But, the writing was still Shannon Messenger writing which is just so easy to read.  Also, the material in which I believe the ideas were taken from is one of my favorite TV shows. <br/><br/>If you read my status updates, you'll see the YA cliche quote.  Go ahead look, it's in every YA action romance.  Once you see it, you'll never forget it.  <br/><br/>Anyway, it might not have been clear, but I believe that this story was a complete rip off of Avatar the Last Airbender.  A TV show from Nick that aired in 2005.  <br/><br/>Some more summary, that is free of spoilers, of this book is that there are four winds.  The South, West, North, and East.  Quite some time ago, the North windwalkers murdered all the West windwalkers except for one.  Vane Westerly.  Audra is an Easterly and tells Vane he is the Last Westerly and only he can master all four languages and save the world.  Each wind has a different language and the only one that is unknown is the Westerly language for the people would rather die than share it to the Nothern windwalkers.  <br/><br/>Now, the concept of Avatar The Last Airbender.  Instead of four languages it's the four elements: water, earth, fire and air.  Aang is the last airbender because the firenation attacked and killed all the airbenders except him.  Only Aang can master all four elements and save the world.  <br/><br/>Both have the girl that helps the main character guy back into their world in which they left.  Katara in ATLA and Audra in LTSF.  Both strong female characters with romances with the main character guy.  <br/><br/>Both have to defeat the leader that killed their people.  <br/><br/>With lack of originality anywhere, I just can't enjoy this book as much as I'd like too.  I will continue reading this series, but only because Shannon Messenger is one of my favorite authors.  <br/><br/>2.5 Stars at the highest.  <br/>",,,1,0,9781442450417,"Tornadoes, Spirits, Orphans, Fiction, Supernatural, Amnesia, Winds, Paranormal fiction, Juvenile fiction, Children's fiction, Supernatural, fiction, Orphans, fiction, Amnesia, fiction, Tornadoes, fiction, Winds, fiction"

Would she be the same as her mother or different?  The way all of the descendants of villains were created, gave a fresh but nostalgic feeling.

Also, although the book takes place only during a couple weeks or so, there was so much character development and bonding. <br/><br/>All of these powers have their ups and downs, and it is definitely shown in the book the bad situations you can get in because of these powers, especially Scam or Ethan.  (They're the same person) He has this voice which can take over, spilling information and the right words to get the receiver to listen and trust you, or... completely hate your guts.  However, I still like his power the best and if I could have any powers in the book, it would probably be his.  His chapters were also my favorite POV to read.  Kelsie, aka Mob, was probably my least favorite character and chapters to read.  I just didn't really connect with her and I felt like her power wasn't very interesting.          <br/><br/>I also really liked Flicker, aka Riley, her power is also really cool, and if I had it, it would be great on tests.  If, I myself wasn't blind anyway.  Her relationship with Anonymous or omg I just forgot his real name, which is kind of ironic considering his power is basically you just forget everything about him, and the actions and words that were spoken with him.  But, anyway, I thought his relationship with Flicker was really sweet, and I am so proud that Flicker spent the effort to make sure she would be able to remember him.<br/><br/><spoiler> I'm a little iffy with the thought that Flicker's sister, Lily, might have a power too.  Maybe with words and storytelling.  But, it also could just be Flicker exaggerating.  <spoiler/> <br/><br/>I didn't really like Nate that much, I feel like if this book continued on as a series, Nate could become the main villain.  I'm pretty sure he was supposed to be written as someone dependable, but Crash's POVs and thoughts really made me doubt him and his abilities.  He literally could become the world's worst dictator with a power like that.  Crash was very unique, and I liked how she really thought about the consequences and about real life.  She was scared and she excepted the fact that she might not be a superhero.  It was very different from the thoughts of the other characters.     <br/><br/>I really liked the suspense and action that follow all the characters through the story.  And the climax was very well written.  However, the resolution, in my opinion, could of had a little work done on it.<br/><br/>Also, the plot was very complicated with many strands going everywhere, and it was great how everything connected in the end of the book.  The bad guys were a little cardboard cut, but we got the hear little tidbits about their actual lives because of Scam.  I thought that that was kind of cool.  <br/><br/>And even though it might seem weird that I have some critical stuff to say about the book, yet I rated it 5 stars it's just because the book was just really that good, and you need to read it!  There is always going to be flaws in a book, and I just happened to point them out, but overall, this might be one of my favorite books this year!

Before then I was prepared to give this book 2 stars.  <br/><br/>Except that I really liked the rest of the book.  And the more I read after that...

I was laughing and shipping the characters, when all of a sudden,<br/><br/>Boom!<br/><br/>Everything starts to go downhill and you are sobbing your eyes out.  <br/>I was just sitting in my bed reading when<br/><img src=""https://38.media.tumblr.com/f8109b254aadcd2203471eb82203eb50/tumblr_nm6vhcUthh1td1nt3o1_500.gif""<br/>tears just start welling up in my eyes.  <br/><br/>The characters in this book feel so real, and that is why I could connect to all of them so well.  Taylor is a teenager, and she has all of these problems that normal teenagers have.  What I liked so much about her character was that she was afraid of saying things.  In so many other books, I find characters just spilling all their feelings and thoughts.  Taylor was nervous, embarrassed, and unsure about what to say.  She made mistakes, but wasn't annoying at all.  <br/><br/>Henry is so cute.  He was a little angry at first, which is totally understandable, but as Taylor and Henry start building up their friendship again from awkward meet ups to understanding each other's problems, they realise that their feelings for each other haven't really gone away.  I thought that Morgan matson did an incredible job at their relationship.  <br/><br/>Lucy started off so mean, and I thought I would hate her.  But even though she was still angry at Taylor, when she noticed something wrong, she pushed down her feelings and tried to confort Taylor as a best friend.  Which led to their friendship again. <br/><br/>Warren and Gelsey were two very quirky siblings which I thought were really funny and great.  Warren and his trivia were just great.  And Gelsey and her ballet.  Perfect characters.<br/><br/>What I loved the most was the relationship that Taylor had with her father.  People always take for granted the things they have around them.  Taylor realises that she always loved her dad, but never really knew him for who he was.  There are all these great father daughter moments, that I loved.  And because of that, the last 50 pages of this book were like this <br/><img src=""https://33.media.tumblr.com/8be7df19381e5b1b08d12bc95fe6f662/tumblr_nmk1d2SrfF1twixiao1_500.gif""<br/>How am I supposed to deal with this?<br/><img src=""https://38.media.tumblr.com/4071eceeeb4720f0fa845f06662e974f/tumblr_nmrei9HtGH1tbhgw8o1_500.gif""<br/>I wasn't sobbing loudly, but I was making strangled breathing sounds because my sister asked annoyingly from the other room, ""Why are you crying.""  <br/><br/>There were some parts near the end where I had so many tears in my eyes, and I couldn't even read the words on the page, they became so blurry.  <br/><br/>I really loved this book, and if you didn't feel for the characters like I did, I am so sorry and shocked because I honestly don't know how you couldn't.  <br/>  ",,,1,0,9781416990673,"Love, JUVENILE FICTION / Social Issues / Friendship, Family life, Fiction, Interpersonal relations, JUVENILE FICTION / Social Issues / Emotions & Feelings, JUVENILE FICTION / Family / Parents, Terminally ill, Juvenile fiction, Families, Love stories, Social Issues, Emotions & Feelings, Friendship, Romance fiction, Family, Parents, Children's fiction, Interpersonal relations, fiction, Family life, fiction, Pennsylvania, fiction, Love, fiction"

Okay, so the people can be sorted by color, but it's not really that simple.  There isn't a bad side and a good side.  There are multiple adult groups who are fighting against each other and the groups of children, who are more or less alone.  <br/><br/>Ruby... What can I say about her?  With no contact with boys for over 5 years, she seems to be pretty okay with handling them.  And with an education of a 4th grader, she seems way too smart.  Also, how can she remember so much history details from six years ago?  I can barely remember the topics of this past school year.  But, that was so minor, it didn't really affect me.  <br/><br/>The story was so different, and creative.  I really liked the side characters.  How many oranges are left, how many reds are free?  Why did some camps have yellows and others not.  Why is the ""resistance"" so evil?  I am looking forward to this book.  I love it so much.  <br/><br/>The author did a really good job of explaining the world and how it worked through Ruby, which I thought was fabulous.  The romance between Ruby and Liam was a little forced, and I probably would have liked it much better if they remained friends in this book, and maybe in the next book, implicated a relationship.  Because, even though they had feelings for each other, Ruby and Liam only acted on them because Clancy had tried to force himself on Ruby.  <br/><br/>And even though most of this is kind of a complaint, I love the book as a whole too much.

Not even close to being a jock, which is also great.  Gia was very interesting.  There was lots of character development that was wonderful.  <br/><br/>Bec.  She was probably my favourite character.  She was very different, in the way that even though she dressed ""goth and emo"" brought out Gia's (the popular good girl) best qualities and made her a better person.  Without breaking any laws or doing anything considered bad, she managed to pull off being a rebel character that allowed Gia to rebel as well.  <br/><br/>This book was so freaking amazing, on par with Anna and the French Kiss if not better.  Recommending this for anyone who likes cutsy contemporary that isn't just fluff as well.  Kasie West really knows how to make her writing flow and write likeable characters.  She also added in some real life problems in teenagers now, which was very interesting to read. <br/><br/>Oh, something I really really liked, was the fact that, unlike lots of YA contemporary, Gia and Hayden do not kiss the first time they meet.  There was build up, with just a little bit of conflict, that made the impact of when they really did kiss so much bigger.  <br/><br/>Love, love, this book, go read it now, you won't be disappointed.

As the blood pours out, a demon arrives and basically becomes a Sebastian to a Ciel ( a Black Butler reference)  but with a little more power.  She becomes a little power crazy, and also the top dog at her school.  Torturing a few of her enemies, she is feeling great.  Yada yada yada.  Things happen, she gets her revenge, and the demon is going to take her soul...but then falls in love.  Or something to that extent.  Not much heavy paranormal.  <br/><br/>What I got was very different.  There are monsters and a whole sick twisted game going on, and she happens to be a key player.  As the book continues, it gets more twisted and creepy, with unexplained deaths that cause the main character to start going insane.  She sees things in the mirror and across the street.  She doesn't know who to trust or who she can talk to.  Nothing is as it seems. <br/><br/>Although it was kinda confusing and boring at times.  Some parts I don't think made any sense, but I guess these things can be explained in the nest book.  I had no idea that this is going to be a trilogy, and I don't know if I will even read the second book. <br/><br/>I'm not going to lie to you, I chose this book because of the cover.  And even now, this is probably in the top 10 if not the top 5 favourite covers I have on my shelves.    <br/><br/>Also, they absolutely butchered book two's cover.

The writing in this book was not the best.  The changing POV's in the beginning were very difficult to understand.  The grammar in this book also needs lots of work on.  There was also one last chapter told in first POV of Luke, which was needed for the information, but could have been told in a different way.  <br/><br/>However, I never really lose interest in books because they are copies of something else.  Because if the something else was also something that I enjoyed, how can I not like the copy?  Plus I didn't understand most of the references that the bad reviews were talking about.  I guess that made this book easier on the plagiarism, if any was there.<br/><br/>I guess I am also one of the lucky few not to be bored the entire book.  I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the action, even if the grammar was a bit annoying.  But, that was very easy to get over because I read a lot of fanfiction.  <br/><br/>I am so very late on the bandwagon of The Mortal Instruments, but this summer I promised myself that I would binge read the entire series and the Infernal Devices.  <br/><br/>So 5 stars for the story, but 1 star for the writing.

But it was a fun short read that I litterly started at 9 PM today and finished at 11 PM.,,,1,0,9780316084222,"Fathers and daughters, Family problems, Conduct of life, Remarriage, Fiction, Families, Juvenile fiction, Children's fiction, Conduct of life, fiction, Fathers and daughters, fiction, Illinois, fiction"

However, this book is a real disappointment.  The main character Grace, moves to Korea for senior year to run away from family drama and problems.  Upon getting there she is immediate friends with her roommate Sophie.  Sophie introduces her to her twin brother Jason.  We know right after that Jason is the love interest even if he is a jerk and she ""hates"" him.<br/><br/>Jason has no personality.  He is constantly changing as if the author didn't know what type of boy she wanted to write about and it makes him seem really bipolar.  Grace is one of those annoying main characters who is extremely stupid.  Not in the way of academics, she likes to recite the periodic table of elements when she is stressed and sad.  She doesn't know how to speak Korean, but doesn't bother to try and learn any of it until Jason offers to tutor her.  Her family, excluding her younger sister, is racist.  Even though Grace moved to Korea for her own account, she doesn't want to try anything new.  ""A snicker escapes my lips. KPOP.  Heh.""  She doesn't need to think it is funny. <br/><br/>The love story is so fake.  The author tried to make it seem more realistic by making them dislike each other first, but it just doesn't work.  And obviously in the end, they both confess their undying love for each other and live happily ever after.  But not before, she confesses the major family problems and hardships of her older brother's suicide, which of course she blamed herself for.  <br/><br/>All in all, this book was flat, boring, and annoying.  I had to force myself to finish it and I am not really sure why.  Don't waste your time.   ",,,1,0,,No ISBN

I usually end up enjoying class read books, like The Outsiders and Touching Spirit Bear, but this book was not good.  The relationship that Stargirl and Leo had was unbelievable.  Leo has never really talked to Stargirl ever in his life, when Stargirl sends him a letter that says, ""I love you.""  All of a sudden, Leo falls head over heels for this girl and they immediately become like boyfriend and girlfriend.  A girl who always seems to know about people's birthdays and brings her rat to school everyday, who you barely know, sends you a letter that says that she loves you. If that happened to me, I would freak out and most likely call the cops.  Then, Leo, who does not want to be shunned by the rest of his classmates, stops seeing Stargirl.  And right when he finally starts to accept Stargirl for who she is again, she freaking moves to another state.  15 years in the future, Leo has never talked to Stargirl for any of that time, and she send him a present for his birthday, then the story ends.  The relationship that was built up, was worse than Twilight, and the ending was just stupid.

The book started out okay, with the main character training hard for swimming and working hard for school.  What I did not like was that this main character throws away everything she has worked for, for a guy.  A boy that she met literally a few weeks ago.  What is that supposed to show people?  And then and the last moment she rushes to Junior Nationals and breaks the record for an event, when she hasn't trained in a few days.  You absolutely cannot write a book that shows if you stop caring and go run after a boy, you will do better than when you worked hard.  I just simply did not enjoy the plot and how stupid the main character was.  But, if you do enjoy fluff like this, go ahead and read on.     ",True,,1,0,9780316220156,Error fetching data

Reason 1: I did not think that the book was realistic.  Now I know what you are thinking, ""Cancer is real!  Why are you so insensitive?""  I am well aware that cancer is very real, I just think that their relationship escalated way to fast.  Also, the characters just seemed to perfect.  I am not talking about their health, but their personalities.  Augustus Waters and his whole cigarette thing but it doesn't kill him,  I mean what kind of teenager actually thinks about stuff like that.  In all, even though the main plot is realistic, it just did not give me the feel to fall in love with the characters and feel sad when they died.
